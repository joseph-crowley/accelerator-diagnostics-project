## Recommendations for New Developers

1. **Getting Started**: Clone the repository, navigate to the project root directory and run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.
2. **Database Setup**: Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the database migrations.
3. **Static Files**: After making changes to static files, run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect all static files into the `static/` directory.
4. **New Features**: When adding new features, consider whether they warrant a new app or can be incorporated into an existing one.
5. **Models and Migrations**: After creating a new model, don't forget to create a new migration using `python manage.py makemigrations` and apply it using `python manage.py migrate`.
6. **Testing**: Ensure to write tests for your code. Django's test framework makes this quite easy. You can run tests using `python manage.py test`.

If you have any questions or issues, consult Django's excellent [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/), or ask chatGPT for help. Welcome to the project!

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for New Developers

### General

1. **What is the purpose of this Django project?**
   - This Django project is designed to manage and display information for the DiRPi Project, including user registration, and related apps.

2. **How do I get started with the development environment?**
   - Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, install any dependencies, and run `python manage.py runserver`.

### Django-Specific

3. **What version of Django are we using?**
   - Refer to the `requirements.txt` file to check which version of Django the project is currently using.

4. **How do I create a new app within the project?**
   - Run `python manage.py startapp your_app_name`. Don't forget to add your app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` file.

5. **Where do I place static files like images, JavaScript, or CSS?**
   - Place static files in the `static/` directory, and run `python manage.py collectstatic` to make them available for the project.

6. **How do I make database migrations?**
   - After changing any `models.py` files, run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create new migrations and `python manage.py migrate` to apply them.

### Codebase Organization

7. **Why are forms, models, and views separated into different folders in each app?**
   - This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and navigate the codebase. Each folder contains Python files pertinent to a specific part of the Django MVC architecture.

8. **What is the `templates/` folder used for?**
   - The `templates/` folder holds HTML templates that Django will render. Templates specific to an app are located in the `templates/` folder within each app's directory.

9. **How do I add a new URL route?**
   - Add the new URL pattern in the `urls.py` file within the relevant app. If the URL is general to the entire project, add it in the `urls.py` file within the `DiRPi_Website` directory.

10. **What's the process for pushing code changes?**
    - Make sure your code is well-tested and adheres to the project's coding standards. Create a pull request and await code review.

### Debugging and Testing

11. **How do I debug the code?**
    - Django's error messages are usually informative. You can also use Python's `pdb` for debugging. Insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` in your code to set a breakpoint.

12. **How do I run tests?**
    - Run `python manage.py test` to execute all the tests. You can also specify a specific app to test like `python manage.py test core`.

13. **Where should I write tests?**
    - Each app has a `tests.py` file. You can write unit tests there or create a `tests/` directory within the app for more complex testing scenarios.

14. **I see `__pycache__` directories everywhere. What are they?**
    - These are generated by Python and store bytecode. They improve performance but can safely be ignored from version control.

15. **How do I interact with the database directly?**
    - You can use the Django shell by running `python manage.py shell` to interact with the Django ORM or use database-specific tools to interact directly with the database.
