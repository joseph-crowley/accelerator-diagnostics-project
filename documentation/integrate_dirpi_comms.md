## Plan to Integrate DiRPi Comms Functionality into 'experiment' App:

### 1. **User Interface & Views**
The Django app should have views that enable users to do the following:

a. **Start and Stop DiRPi**:
   - Based on your notes, this functionality is vital. You can integrate this in `dirpi_device_control_views.py`.
   - Add two buttons: "Start" and "Stop". These buttons should trigger the respective shell commands for starting and stopping the DiRPi.

b. **View and Modify Configuration**:
   - Within `dirpi_device_control_views.py`, allow users to view and edit `config.ini`. This might involve a form or a simple editor interface.
   - Users should also be able to view the `schedule.txt` and potentially switch it to `schedule.json` if decided later.

c. **Monitor Groups of DiRPi Devices**:
   - Use the `dirpi_group_monitor_views.py` to display the status of each DiRPi device within a group. This could include its current IP address, whether it's active or not, and its last known status.

d. **View List of DiRPi Groups**:
   - Use the `dirpi_group_list_views.py` to show a list of all DiRPi groups, with a link to the monitor view for each group.

### 2. **Models & Data Storage**

a. **Configuration**:
   - If you plan to allow users to edit configuration settings via the web interface, consider creating a Django model for configuration settings in `models`. This way, you can keep track of changes and make it easier to read and write to `config.ini`.

b. **Run Numbers**:
   - Consider a model for Run Numbers to keep track of local runs, global runs, and dirpi numbers. It would interface with the mentioned URLs in the notes for fetching this information.

c. **Device and Group Details**:
   - You already have `dirpi_device.py` and `dirpi_group.py` in your `models` folder. Ensure these models capture necessary details such as IP addresses, group memberships, statuses, etc.

### 3. **Backend Functionality & Management Commands**

a. **Cron Scheduling**:
   - Create a management command (within `management/commands/`) that allows Django to interface with `crontab` for scheduling purposes. This will allow your app to set, view, or modify the DiRPi's scheduling.

b. **Data Transfer**:
   - Consider creating a management command to handle data transfer operations, given the steps mentioned in your notes. This would cover connecting to `tau`, copying data, and other related tasks.

c. **Device Commands**:
   - Implement backend functionality (either in the views or as separate utilities) to execute commands on the DiRPi, such as starting, stopping, and fetching run numbers.

### 4. **Forms**

a. **Device & Group Management**:
   - Use the existing forms (`dirpi_device_form.py` and `dirpi_group_form.py`) to allow users to add, edit, or remove DiRPi devices and groups.

b. **Configuration Editing**:
   - Create a form that represents the configuration settings, allowing users to make changes and save them to `config.ini`.

### 5. **Tests**

a. Ensure that you expand your test coverage in `tests` to cover the new functionalities. This would involve testing views, models, and forms related to the DiRPi comms functionalities.

### 6. **Future Enhancements**:

a. **Visualization & Analysis Tools**:
   - Consider implementing tools or graphs to visualize data and insights gained from the DiRPi.

b. **Notifications**:
   - Implement a system to notify users of any irregularities or significant events from the DiRPi, leveraging Django's messaging framework.

### 7. **Security**

a. Ensure that all interactions with the DiRPi, especially those that involve running commands, are secure. Only authorized users should have access to control functionalities.
